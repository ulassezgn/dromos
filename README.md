# dromos

**Modular hardware components for compute-intensive systems and custom microarchitectures.**  
Dromos is a hardware design library written in Verilog/SystemVerilog that provides reusable, synthesizable modules for building AI accelerators, processor cores, and parallel computing architectures.

---

### 🔧 Features

- ✅ Fully synthesizable modules (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
- 🧱 Modular, reusable components with parameterizable design
- ⚙️ Suitable for AI accelerators, CPU datapaths, and hardware co-processors
- 🧠 Optimized for use in custom ML hardware and high-throughput compute systems

---

### 📁 Modules (Planned / In Progress)

- Arithmetic units (adders, multipliers, etc.)
- Memory controllers & scratchpads
- Pipeline stages & hazard units
- Instruction decoders
- Matrix/vector compute blocks
- Control logic blocks for custom accelerators

> 📌 Contributions and extensions (e.g., VHDL versions, HLS wrappers) are welcome in future versions.

---

### 💡 Motivation

This library was born out of a need for **clean, flexible, and efficient hardware building blocks** while working on processor design and AI hardware research. Dromos aims to accelerate both **educational prototyping** and **research-grade system design.**
